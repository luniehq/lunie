We identified several core customers for Voyager:

1) Investors
- They know what a wallet is
- They know how to send/receive coins
- They are maybe not familiar with staking
- They are maybe not familiar with governance and voting on the blockchain
- They are probably security conscious
- They want to use Voyager as a tool to create a profit
- They want to see if they created a profit
- They want to see if the experienced a loss
- They probably use Windows

2) Crypto Beginners
- They want a wallet to see the amount of tokens they own
- They want to send/receive tokens
- They don’t want to participate
- They are not interested in the blockchain meta data

3) Crypto Enthusiasts
- They want to understand how Cosmos works
- They will probably not use Voyager everyday

4) Wallet Builders
- They want to build their own wallet
- They want to see how Voyager is build for inspiration

We will focus on 1) and 2) as we assume these are the biggest groups of users at release.

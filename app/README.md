ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Lunie. We're making staking easy and accessible for everyone. This is the repo for the Lunie web and mobile apps.

## Development Dependencies

Install the following dependencies if you wish to run lunie on developer mode or [contribute](https://github.com/luniehq/lunie/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Node

Lunie requires Node.js `>=10.13.0`. If you have a different version of Node.js installed, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install the correct version. Now to install the Node.js version run:

```bash
nvm install 10.*
```

---

## Lunie Development

### Check out Lunie

With Node installed, you're ready to check out the source code. Afterwards install the dependencies for this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luniehq/lunie.git
cd lunie
yarn
```

### Start

You can simply start the frontend:

```bash
yarn serve
```

The front end will run on its own, however if you want to interact with real data, please read on below.

#### Lunie Backend

Lunie requires a GraphQL API to work as expected. You can use our API for local development:

```bash
VUE_APP_GRAPHQL_URL=https://staging-api.lunie.io yarn serve
```

If you would like to use the API in production email us at hello [at] lunie.io.

### Ledger Cosmos App

> **IMPORTANT:** Only use Ledger devices that you **bought factory new** or **trust fully**.

Lunie supports sending transactions through the `Cosmos` app for [Ledger Nano](https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) hardware wallet. To install the `CÃ¸smos` app on your device you'll have to:

1. Download the Ledger Live app [here](https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live)
2. Connect your Ledger via USB and update to the latest firmware
3. Go to the Ledger Live App Store, and download the `CÃ¸smos` application (this can take a while). **Note:** You may have to enable `Dev Mode` in the Ledger Live Settings to be able to download the `CÃ¸smos` application
4. Navigate to the `CÃ¸smos` app on your Ledger device

### Code Conventions / Coding Style

All code needs to conform to our linting rules. This will be tested in our continuous integration.

To test if your code conforms to the rules run:

```
yarn lint
```

To fix linting errors automatically (as long as this is possible) run:

```
yarn lint --fix
```

### Deploy

Create the bundle to deploy Lunie you can run:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Mobile

#### Android

Dependencies:

- Android Studio
- Gradle updated to 5.1.1 (Android Studio > File > Project Structure)

You will probably also want a virtual Android device which you can create from inside the Android Studio.

To run the Android version of Lunie in development:

```bash
$ yarn build:mobile
$ yarn remove @capacitor/core @capacitor/android
$ npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/android
$ npx cap sync android
$ npx cap open android
```

#### iOS

Dependencies:

- [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/getting-started/dependencies/#ios-development)
- [Xcode 10](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation)

To open Lunie in Xcode:

1. Build Lunie for production

```bash
$ yarn build:mobile
```

or ...

1. Build Lunie for development

```bash
$ yarn build:mobile:dev
```

2. After a new build, you need to run the following command. This step can take up to 20 minutes to complete if you've never used Cocoapods before.

```bash
$ npx cap sync ios
```

3. This will open Xcode with Lunie loaded

```bash
$ npx cap open ios
```

Once Xcode is open, just click the Play button to run Lunie on your preferred Simulator or Device.

## Testing

If you would like to run all the tests you can run:~

```bash
yarn test
```

### Unit tests

Lunie uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) to run unit tests. You can run _all_ the unit tests with the following command:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

For a single test file (e.g. `PageValidator.spec.js`) run the unit tests like this:

```bash
yarn test:unit PageValidator
```

### Code coverage

To check test coverage locally run following after having run unit tests. It will spin up a webserver and provide you with a link to the coverage report web page.

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

### End to end tests

Start Lunie locally, then run the tests:

```bash
yarn test:e2e:local --fe=http://localhost:9080 --api=https://staging-api.lunie.io
```

To run only some tests, provide the name of the e2e test file you want to run (i.e. for `send.spec.js`):

```bash
yarn test:e2e:local --fe=http://localhost:9080 --api=https://staging-api.lunie.io --filter=*send*
```

To run the e2e tests on multiple browsers use [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/). You must set the environment variables `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` aquired from Browserstack first.

```bash
yarn test:e2e:browserstack --fe=https://app.lunie.io --api=https://staging-api.lunie.io --filter=*send*
```

To run the e2e tests on the Westend network (our chosen Substrate testnet network) it suffices to add the `network` flag to the prior command:

```bash
yarn test:e2e:browserstack --fe=https://app.lunie.io --api=https://staging-api.lunie.io --network="polkadot-testnet"
```

## Flags
